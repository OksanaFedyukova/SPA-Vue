## Vue.js SPA with Graphs and Vuex State Management

This is a single-page application (SPA) built with Vue.js that displays data from an API endpoint and visualizes it using graphs. The app uses Vuex for state management and a graphing library of your choice.

## Getting Started
To get started with this app, follow these steps:

### Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

### Run Unit Tests with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)

```sh
npm run test:unit
```
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm install.
3. Set up your API endpoint that will return the data you want to visualize.
4. Define your Vuex store to manage the app's state. You can define the state, mutations, actions, and getters in separate files and import them into your store.js file.
5. Create a new Vue.js component that will display the data retrieved from the API endpoint. You can use Axios or another HTTP client library to fetch the data from the API endpoint.
6. Use your chosen graphing library to create one or more graphs that visualize the data retrieved from the API endpoint.
7. Add the Vue.js component and the graphs to your app's template.
Use Vuex to manage the state of your app, so that changes to the data or the graphs are automatically reflected in the UI.

## Dependencies
 This app depends on the following packages:

### Vue.js
### Vuex
### Axios (or another HTTP client library)
### Your chosen graphing library (such as Chart.js or D3.js)
